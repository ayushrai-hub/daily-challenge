# Project Brief

**Purpose:** Foundation document defining core requirements and goals of the Daily Challenge platform.

- Defines project scope and objectives
- Captures key stakeholder needs and high-level success criteria
- Serves as the source of truth for all subsequent memory bank files

**Tag Management Update (May 2025):**
- Tag creation is now fully separated from problem creation. Only approved tags are added to the main tag table, while all user-suggested tags are stored in problem metadata for admin review. This prevents duplicate tags, ensures case-insensitive uniqueness, and supports a robust admin approval workflow.
