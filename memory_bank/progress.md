# Progress

**May 2025 Update:**
- All verification, metrics, and test suite work is DONE (all tests pass, no skips/failures)
- Tag management refactor completed: tag creation is now separated from problem creation; user-suggested tags are stored in problem_metadata and only admin-approved tags are created in the tag table. This resolves unique constraint and session issues.
- Admin UI for reviewing/approving tags is planned as next step.
- Email delivery ops and metrics are documented and operational
- Next: Content pipeline and LLM integration (see end of file)
