# Active Context

## Current Focus

The main focus is currently on comprehensive system improvements across multiple areas:

- **Tagging System Enhancement:**
  - Tag system has been refactored to support multiple tag types (language, skill_level, topic, etc.)
  - Tag creation is now fully separated from problem creation: only admin-approved tags are added to the tag table, while user-suggested tags are stored in problem_metadata for later admin review
  - Multi-parent hierarchical tag relationships have been implemented with tag_hierarchy junction table
  - Comprehensive tag normalization system verified with multi-parent relationships
  - Enhanced tag hierarchy with optimized indexing for performance
  - Improved cycle detection to prevent circular relationships 
  - Tag alias mapping system implemented to handle variant forms (e.g., 'nodejs' → 'Node.js')
  - Automated parent category assignment for tags based on their name and context
  - Content pipeline integration updated to support multi-parent tag relationships and robust tag approval workflow
  - Database schemas and API endpoints have been updated to support new tag structures
  - Tag seeding for development database has been implemented

- **Database Schema Improvements:**
  - Database models refactored for extensibility and type safety
  - Resolved circular dependencies between models with centralized association tables
  - Updated Alembic migrations to support schema changes

  - Resolved circular dependencies between models by creating a centralized association_tables module
  - Fixed import paths in affected files to use the new centralized association tables
  - Created update scripts that don't reset the database
  - Manually tested the authentication flow to verify it works correctly

## Current Focus

Ensuring database and authentication systems work correctly:

- Verify model relationships and associations function properly
- Test authentication flows with the fixed database schema
- Implement proper database update processes without data loss
- Organize code changes into logical sequential commits
- Verify API endpoints are functioning correctly with the updated schema

## Key Information for Future Development

1. Tag System Enhancements:
   - Consider implementing tag-based filtering for problems and content
   - Add tag popularity metrics to identify trending topics
   - Develop automatic tagging suggestions based on content analysis
   - Create tag visualization and exploration UI components
   - Add batch operations for tag management (bulk assign/remove)

2. Database Configuration:
   - Database URL is constructed from individual components
   - Special characters are properly escaped in URLs
   - Connection test is performed during initialization
   - Pydantic V2 compatibility is maintained

2. API Structure:
   - Routers are organized by resource type
   - Dependency injection is used for database sessions
   - Middleware handles request tracking and error handling
   - CORS is configured for development environment
   - Authentication applied at router level for security
   - Role-based access control for admin-only operations
   - Rate limiting on public endpoints

3. Testing:
   - Comprehensive test suite covers all components
   - API endpoints are fully tested
   - Configuration is validated
   - Schema validations are verified

4. Environment Management:
   - Settings are loaded from environment variables
   - Different environments are supported (dev, test, prod)
   - Configuration is cached for performance
   - Error handling is consistent across the application

5. Background Task Processing:
   - Celery used for asynchronous and scheduled tasks
   - Redis serves as both broker and result backend
   - Tasks organized into separate queues by domain
   - Periodic task scheduling via Celery Beat
   - Custom base task class for consistent logging and error handling
   - Task monitoring via Flower dashboard
   - Health checks implemented for system monitoring

## Next Steps

1. All core Celery scheduling, logging, and retry mechanisms are implemented and operational.
2. Reminder automation (such as verification reminders) is not a current priority and will be handled as a future enhancement.
3. Task 5 and its main subtasks are now DONE except for reminder automation.
   - Create seed data script for initial tag hierarchy
   - Test all model relationships and constraints

2. Implement content pipeline basics (Task #6):
   - Create manual content entry system
   - Implement tagging and categorization
   - Set up content vetting workflow

3. Create user subscription system (Task #3):
   - Implement subscription endpoints
   - Add tag selection interface
   - Create subscription status tracking

4. Connect email service:
   - Integrate with email service provider (Resend API)
   - Create email templates
   - Implement delivery tracking

## Current Architecture

- **Models**: SQLAlchemy models with a common BaseModel
- **Schemas**: Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
  - Create schemas with required fields and defaults
  - Read schemas with proper ORM conversion
- **Repositories**: Data access layer with CRUD operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Alembic migrations

## Database Schema Management

The project follows strict database schema migration guidelines:

- Create Alembic migrations for all model changes
- Use manual migrations for special cases like PostgreSQL enum modifications
- Added proper enum values to all model definitions through targeted migration files
- Always review autogenerated migrations before applying them
- When making changes that affect association tables, centralize them in association_tables.py
- Use update_without_reset.sh script instead of init_db.sh to avoid data loss
- The Tag hierarchy system has been enhanced with multi-parent support using the tag_hierarchy junction table
- Tag normalization system verified with multi-parent relationships through comprehensive test scripts
- Problem repository updated to use multi-parent relationships when creating content
- Tag mapper enhanced to intelligently assign multiple parent categories to tags
- Timestamps added to tag_hierarchy relationships for better tracking
- Custom UUID serialization system implemented for consistent type handling across the application
- All Pydantic schemas updated to V2 compatibility with ConfigDict instead of class-based Config
- SQLAlchemy code updated to use 2.0 compatible patterns

## Recent Updates

- **Subscription Management:**
  - Subscription status (active, paused, unsubscribed) can be paused, resumed, unsubscribed, and reactivated from both backend and frontend.
  - User model and API serialization now strictly match Pydantic schemas, including `created_at` and `updated_at` for both user and tags.
  - `/auth/me` endpoint always returns a fully serialized user object, preventing SQLAlchemy serialization errors.
  - Frontend now robustly reflects subscription status and tag changes in both Profile and Subscription Management components.
  - Error handling and user feedback for subscription/tag actions improved.

## Next Steps
- Push current codebase to GitHub.
- Plan and execute UUID/public_id migration for all public-facing models.
- Continue monitoring email delivery and Celery task reliability.
- Update documentation and onboarding guides as needed.
