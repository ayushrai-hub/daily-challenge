      "taskTitle": "Create user subscription system",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the user subscription system implementation into specific subtasks covering backend API development, email validation, subscription state management, frontend form creation, and security considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple interconnected components including API endpoints, email validation, subscription management, and frontend development. It requires both backend and frontend work with security considerations for user data, making it highly complex."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement email delivery with Resend API",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the email delivery system implementation into subtasks covering Resend API integration, template creation for different email types, error handling, delivery tracking, and email authentication setup.",
      "reasoning": "Integration with external APIs, creating multiple email templates, implementing retry logic, and configuring email authentication make this moderately complex. The task involves both technical integration and design considerations for the templates."

      "taskTitle": "Set up task scheduling with Celery",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Celery task scheduling implementation into subtasks covering Redis setup, periodic task configuration, retry mechanisms, specific task implementations, monitoring, and logging.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up a distributed task queue with Celery involves configuring infrastructure, implementing multiple task types, and adding monitoring. The retry mechanisms and proper logging add complexity to ensure reliable background processing."

      "taskTitle": "Create content management system",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the content management system into subtasks covering API endpoint development, content validation, tagging system implementation, vetting tier management, content formatting, search functionality, and batch operations.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a comprehensive system for managing challenge content with multiple features including CRUD operations, hierarchical tagging, multi-tier vetting, and search capabilities. The complexity comes from designing a flexible system that can handle various content operations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement content delivery logic",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the content delivery logic implementation into subtasks covering tag matching algorithm, fallback logic, delivery history tracking, content tier preference, service layer development, and query optimization.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires developing sophisticated algorithms for content selection with multiple fallback strategies. Tracking delivery history and optimizing query performance add significant complexity, as the system needs to efficiently match content to users based on multiple criteria."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Develop admin dashboard for content monitoring",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the admin dashboard development into subtasks covering Streamlit setup, view implementations for different metrics, filtering capabilities, authentication, content vetting interface, and reporting functionality.",
      "reasoning": "Creating an admin dashboard with Streamlit is relatively straightforward, but implementing all the required views, authentication, and vetting interfaces adds moderate complexity. The task involves both data visualization and functional interfaces for content management."

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Set up monitoring and alerting for content inventory",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the content inventory monitoring system into subtasks covering monitoring service development, threshold configuration, notification system, dashboard components, scheduled inventory checks, and trend reporting.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a monitoring system with threshold-based alerting and reporting. While not technically complex, it requires careful implementation to ensure accurate inventory tracking and timely notifications, with multiple components for monitoring different aspects of content availability."
