<Overview>

## 1. Overview

This product is a platform designed to deliver daily practical coding, system design, and product thinking challenges directly to engineers. It addresses the problem that engineers, particularly those with less exposure to diverse real-world scenarios, often lack readily available, practical learning opportunities beyond standard algorithms or theoretical concepts. The platform provides authentic engineering scenarios derived from real-world problems.

**Target Audience:**
* Software engineers (Junior, Mid-Level, Senior) seeking to enhance practical problem-solving skills.
* Engineers looking to broaden knowledge into adjacent domains (e.g., backend exploring system design, frontend exploring product thinking).
* Engineers transitioning between technical domains.
* (Future) Tech Leads and Engineering Managers seeking tools for team upskilling and fostering a continuous learning culture.

**Value Proposition:** Provides consistent, high-quality, real-world-derived challenges via convenient channels (initially email, future Slack for teams) to foster continuous learning, improve practical skills across software development, system design, and product thinking, and offer exposure to product development principles in an accessible daily format.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. Content Generation Pipeline (AI-Powered)

* **What it does:** Identifies relevant content from diverse sources (developer communities, Q&A sites, blogs, issue trackers), processes it using an LLM to generate unique problem/solution pairs, tags them appropriately, and manages their quality status.
* **Why it's important:** Provides a scalable way to create a large, diverse repository of practical, high-quality challenges based on real-world engineering experiences. Ensures a continuous flow of new content crucial for daily delivery.
* **How it works:**
    * Integrates with source APIs (e.g., Stack Overflow, GitHub) or uses ethical scraping/parsing (e.g., RSS feeds, blogs) to ingest raw content.
    * Filters content for relevant topics/keywords.
    * An LLM (e.g., GPT via OpenAI API) processes extracted context (problem description, solution details, discussion) to synthesize a standardized challenge format (problem statement, solution).
    * A tiered vetting system ensures quality before problems are approved for delivery:
        * **Tier 1 (Manual/Gold Standard):** Highest quality, manually reviewed and approved. Used preferentially.
        * **Tier 2 (AI-Reviewed):** Passed automated checks and basic AI review, potentially ready but ideally needs human spot-checking.
        * **Tier 3 (Needs Review):** Raw generated content requiring full manual review.
    * Approved problems are tagged internally (e.g., `python`, `system-design`, `api-design`, `debugging`).
    * Tracks source attribution and ensures ethical compliance in content usage.
    * **(MVP Focus):** Integrate 1-2 reliable API sources (e.g., Stack Overflow, GitHub Issues). Basic LLM pipeline with heavy manual review/vetting for Tier 1. Seed database with 20-50 manually vetted Tier 1 problems covering 1-2 core tags.

### 2.2. User-Facing Platform (Personalized Challenge Delivery & Preferences)

* **What it does:** Allows users to subscribe, select areas of interest (tags), manage preferences, and receive daily challenges via their chosen channel (initially email).
* **Why it's important:** Delivers the core value directly to the user in a convenient, habitual format. Personalization via tags increases relevance and engagement.
* **How it works:**
    * Users sign up with their email.
    * They select preferred tags (e.g., `python`, `system-design`, `frontend`) up to a recommended limit (e.g., 3-5 initially) to manage scope.
    * The system delivers a relevant, approved (Tier 1 preferred) problem to their email daily using an email service provider (e.g., Resend API).
    * Fallback logic ensures content delivery even if an exact tag match isn't available for that day (e.g., use a parent tag or a popular related tag).
    * Users can manage their tag preferences and subscription status.
    * **(MVP Focus):** Email delivery via Resend is the sole channel. Basic tag selection and fallback logic.
    * **(Future):** Slack integration via Slackbot for individual and team delivery.

### 2.3. Content & Subscription Management System

* **What it does:** Manages the subscriber base, schedules content delivery based on preferences and history, monitors content inventory and system health, and provides administrative oversight.
* **Why it's important:** Ensures reliable delivery, prevents content repetition for individual users, tracks user engagement (implicitly via active status), proactively alerts administrators to potential content shortages, and allows for quality control management.
* **How it works:**
    * Tracks active subscribers, their tag preferences, and subscription status.
    * A scheduling system (e.g., using Celery) selects appropriate problems (considering tags, fallback logic, user's delivery history, problem vetting status) for daily dispatch.
    * Logs delivery attempts and status for monitoring and debugging.
    * An internal dashboard displays key metrics: subscriber counts, content inventory per tag/vetting tier, delivery success rates, API error rates.
    * **Crucially:** Includes alerts triggered when approved (Tier 1/2) content for any tag combination actively subscribed to by users falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 15 days worth).
    * Provides interfaces for managing content (vetting status updates, tagging).
    * **(MVP Focus):** Core subscriber tracking, tag matching/fallback, scheduling via Celery, basic delivery logging, simple dashboard with inventory monitoring per tag and low-content alerts.

## 5. Development Roadmap

### MVP Requirements (Focus: Validate core email delivery & initial content value)

* **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup**
    * Basic FastAPI backend project structure.
    * Database schema implementation (Users, Problems, Tags, Delivery Log MVP).
    * Basic user subscription system (email capture, status tracking).
    * Resend API integration for sending basic emails.
    * Setup Celery with a broker for task scheduling.
* **Phase 2: Minimal Content Pipeline & Seeding**
    * Manual creation/curation process for initial problems.
    * Seed database with 20-50 high-quality, manually vetted Tier 1 problems covering 1-2 core tags (e.g., `python-general`, `system-design-concepts`).
    * Basic internal tagging system implementation.
    * *Stretch:* Basic ingestion script for 1 API source (e.g., Stack Overflow) with manual trigger and heavy review of output. Basic LLM call structure.
* **Phase 3: Delivery System & Basic Monitoring**
    * Develop clear, readable, mobile-friendly email template.
    * Implement daily delivery scheduler logic using Celery (match tags, use fallback, avoid repeats for user).
    * Implement basic delivery logging.
    * Create a very simple internal dashboard/script to monitor Tier 1 content inventory per tag and trigger low-content email alerts to admin.
    * Implement basic tag selection interface for users during signup.

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP Validation)

* **Post-MVP Phase 1: Content Pipeline Automation & Enrichment**
    * Integrate remaining planned data sources (GitHub Issues, Reddit, Blogs via RSS, HN, Dev.to, etc.).
    * Enhance LLM pipeline: improved prompting, automated checks, potentially AI-assisted vetting (Tier 2).
    * Build out the full content generation pipeline with automated ingestion, processing, and status tracking.
    * Expand tag hierarchy and granularity. Implement robust tag management tools.
    * Refine fallback logic and content selection algorithms.
* **Post-MVP Phase 2: Channel Expansion & Team Features**
    * Full Slack integration: Slackbot, slash commands, team channel delivery.
    * Features for teams: Team-level tag configuration, basic engagement visibility for admins (anonymized if needed).
    * Cohort-based delivery systems (optional).
* **Post-MVP Phase 3: User Engagement, Community & Premium**
    * User profiles, progress tracking (streaks, solved counts).
    * Gamification elements (points, badges, leaderboards).
    * Community features: Forums, discussion threads per challenge, user submissions/voting.
    * Monetization: Explore premium tiers (advanced topics, specialized tracks, personalized learning paths, analytics).
    * Integrations: Explore linking with company knowledge bases, issue trackers (e.g., Jira).

### Scope Definition

* Each phase focuses on delivering usable increments. MVP (Phase 1-3) is purely about validating the core loop: **Subscribe -> Select Tags -> Receive Quality Email Challenge -> Read**. It relies heavily on manually curated content initially.
* Subsequent phases layer on automation, channel diversity, source diversity, user-facing features, and potential monetization based on learnings and strategic priority.
* Each new data source integration, major automation improvement, or new feature (like Slack, Community) should be scoped as a distinct unit building upon the validated core.

<LogicalDependencyChain>

## 6. Logical Dependency Chain

1.  **Foundation:** User subscription system (DB schema, email capture/storage), core email sending mechanism (Resend integration), basic tag definition. (Corresponds largely to MVP Phase 1)
2.  **Initial Content:** Manually create or heavily vet an initial set of Tier 1 problems covering the MVP tags. (MVP Phase 2)
3.  **Delivery Logic:** Implement the scheduler, tag matching (with basic fallback), delivery history tracking, and email template rendering. (MVP Phase 3)
4.  **Minimum Viable Monitoring:** Implement the dashboard/alert component showing content inventory per tag and the critical low-content alert. (MVP Phase 3)
5.  **Basic Content Pipeline:** Build the ingestion logic for 1-2 sources and the basic LLM processing flow. Implement internal tagging and vetting status tracking. (Can start during/after MVP Phase 2, essential for long-term viability but not strictly needed for *first* email send if content is manually seeded).

### Getting to Usable/Visible Frontend

* The first truly usable state is achieved after MVP Phase 3: a user can subscribe, select from initial tags, and start receiving daily emails containing manually approved content. The system can sustain itself minimally with alerts for content running low. Steps 1-4 are essential for this. Step 5 builds the engine for scaling content beyond manual curation.

### Pacing and Scoping

* Start with the simplest delivery path (email).
* Begin content generation with high manual oversight; gradually increase automation and AI assistance as confidence grows.
* Add data sources incrementally after validating via POCs.
* Introduce user-facing features (profiles, Slack) only after the core content delivery is proven reliable and valuable.

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk Category             | Risk Description                                                                 | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical Challenges** | Complexity in integrating diverse source APIs/formats, rate limits, auth issues. | Prioritize reliable APIs over scraping. Conduct POCs for each source. Implement robust error handling, exponential backoff, caching. Use multiple API keys if possible/allowed. |
|                           | LLM output quality, consistency, uniqueness, and cost variability.               | Heavy reliance on manual vetting (Tier 1) initially. Define clear quality criteria & prompts. Implement automated checks for Tier 2. Monitor costs, explore models/providers. User feedback loop. |
|                           | Email deliverability issues (spam filters, provider outages).                   | Use reputable ESP (Resend, etc.). Monitor deliverability metrics. Implement SPF, DKIM, DMARC. Consider secondary provider as backup. Provide clear unsubscribe options.             |
| **Content** | Insufficient high-quality, approved content for specific tag combinations.       | Implement content sufficiency alerts early (MVP Phase 3). Diversify sources over time. Define efficient vetting workflow. Use fallback tag logic for delivery.                     |
|                           | Vetting process becomes a bottleneck, slowing content availability.              | Start with narrow tag focus. Streamline vetting criteria/tools. Gradually introduce AI-assisted vetting (Post-MVP). Allow trusted community members to help (Future).             |
|                           | Source APIs change, deprecate, or become unavailable.                            | Monitor API status/changelogs. Design ingestion layer flexibly. Have backup sources planned. Diversify sources early.                                                             |
| **MVP Scoping** | Building too much (over-engineering) or too little for MVP validation.           | Strict focus on the core loop (Subscribe -> Select -> Receive Email). Defer non-essentials. Use manually vetted content initially to decouple content quality risk from delivery risk. |
|                           | Insufficient initial content pipeline to sustain beyond manual seeding.          | Pre-seed sufficient MVP content. Implement low-content alerts early. Prioritize building the basic automated pipeline soon after core delivery is live.                         |
| **Resource Constraints** | Limited development time/budget impacting scope or quality.                     | Phased rollout focuses resources. Ruthlessly prioritize features based on core value validation. Leverage open-source libraries/managed services.                               |
|                           | Content generation/vetting overhead exceeds available resources.                 | Rely on manual processes initially where automation is complex (plan to automate later). Focus MVP on limited tags/sources. Explore AI assistance for vetting post-MVP.          |
